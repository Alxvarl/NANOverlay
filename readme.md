This is a WIP Project. More info will be avaliable soon.

NANOverlay is a program that allows an overlay to appear after pressing a combinatsion of buttons.
This overlay can display "Apps" inside of it, that can be interacted with within the overlay.
Apps can be freely created by users, and a documentation will be released after this program exits the "WIP" phase.
